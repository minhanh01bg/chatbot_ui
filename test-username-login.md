# Test Identifier Login Feature

## Changes Made

1. **Database Schema** - Added `username` field to User table
2. **AuthForm Component** - Changed from email input to identifier input (supports both username and email)
3. **Validation Schema** - Updated to validate identifier instead of email
4. **Database Queries** - Added `getUserByUsername` function
5. **Login Service** - Updated to send identifier to backend API
6. **NextAuth Configuration** - Updated credentials provider to use identifier
7. **Login/Register Pages** - Updated state management and form handling to use identifier
8. **API Routes** - Updated to send FormData instead of JSON to backend API

## Testing Steps

1. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to login page**
   - Go to `/login`
   - Verify that the form now shows "Username" instead of "Email Address"
   - Verify placeholder shows "your_username" instead of email format

3. **Navigate to register page**
   - Go to `/register`
   - Verify that the form now shows "Username" instead of "Email Address"
   - Verify description mentions username instead of email

4. **Test form validation**
   - Try submitting with empty username - should show validation error
   - Try submitting with username less than 3 characters - should show validation error
   - Try submitting with valid username and password

5. **Check console logs**
   - Login attempts should log "Authentication attempt initiated for username: [username]"
   - API calls should send username instead of email

## Notes

- Backend API `/api/v1/login` and `/api/v1/register` now receive FormData with username and password fields
- Frontend form accepts both username and email as identifier
- Database migration may be needed to add username column
- Existing users with only email will need username field populated

## API Changes

The API routes now send FormData to the backend instead of JSON:

**Before:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

**After:**
```
FormData:
- username: "user123" or "user@example.com" (identifier field)
- password: "password123"
```
